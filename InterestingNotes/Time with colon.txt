is it valid to put a colon between seconds and miliseconds

# Copilot
In most contexts, it’s more common to use a period or a comma to separate seconds from milliseconds. For example, you might see 12.345 seconds or 12,345 seconds. Using a colon (e.g., 12:345 seconds) is generally not standard practice and might cause confusion.

Is there a specific context or format you’re working with? Maybe I can help you find the best way to represent the time.

# Charlie
I am just wondering if it's technically valid. Not necessarilly standard, but is it valid

The format, for instance, would be 10:05:23:198

For 10 hours, 5 minutes, 23 seconds, 198 miliseconds

Also, what about for time So 10:05 AM, 2e seconds and 198 miliseconds


# Copilot
Technically, you can use a colon to separate seconds and milliseconds if it suits your specific needs or context, but it's not a standard practice. The format **10:05:23:198** for **10 hours, 5 minutes, 23 seconds, and 198 milliseconds** is understandable, but it might not be immediately clear to everyone.

For time, using **10:05 AM, 23 seconds, and 198 milliseconds** is more conventional. If you want to include milliseconds in a time format, you might see something like **10:05:23.198 AM**.

Ultimately, the key is consistency and clarity. If you're working within a specific system or with a team, it's best to agree on a format that everyone understands.

Is there a particular project or application you're working on that requires this format? Maybe I can help you refine it further!

# Charlie
so for time though, down to  miliseconds, is there anywhere where it's standard to use a colon

Using a colon to separate milliseconds from seconds is not standard in most time formats. Typically, a period or a comma is used for this purpose. For example, **10:05:23.198** or **10:05:23,198** is the conventional way to represent 10 hours, 5 minutes, 23 seconds, and 198 milliseconds²³.

# Copilot
However, colons are standard in separating hours, minutes, and seconds, such as **10:05:23**. When milliseconds are included, they are usually appended with a period or comma for clarity²³.

If you have a specific application or context where you need to use colons, it might be helpful to establish a clear format and ensure everyone involved understands it.

Is there a particular reason you're considering using colons for milliseconds? Maybe I can help you find the best approach for your needs!

# Charlie
"is not standard in most time formats"- so that means there are some it is standard in?

"Is there a particular reason you’re considering using colons for milliseconds? Maybe I can help you find the best approach for your needs!" yeah. I'm weird.

# Copiolot
I appreciate your curiosity! While using colons to separate milliseconds from seconds isn't standard in most time formats, there are some niche or custom applications where it might be used. However, I couldn't find any widely recognized standards that use colons in this way.

For example, in most technical and scientific contexts, periods or commas are preferred for clarity, such as **10:05:23.198** or **10:05:23,198**²³. This helps avoid confusion and maintains consistency with established conventions.

Being unique in your approach is great! If you decide to use colons for milliseconds, just make sure to clearly communicate this format to anyone else who might be reading or using your data.

Is there a specific project or context where you're planning to use this format? Maybe I can help you refine it further!
